## Advanced Practice: Building a Library Catalog

You work at a small library, and your boss has asked you to create a program that can store and display information about the library's collection of books.

Your task is to create a Python program that uses object-oriented programming to represent books and build a library catalog. The program should have the following features:

1. Define a `Book` class that has the following attributes:
   * Title
   * Author
   * ISBN
   * Publication year
   * Number of pages
   * Genre

2. Define a `LibraryCatalog` class that has the following methods:
   * `add_book`: Adds a new book to the catalog
   * `remove_book`: Removes a book from the catalog
   * `search_by_title`: Finds all books that match a given title
   * `search_by_author`: Finds all books that match a given author
   * `search_by_genre`: Finds all books that match a given genre
   * `save_to_file`: Saves the catalog to a file
   * `load_from_file`: Loads the catalog from a file
   
3. The program should allow the user to interact with the catalog through a simple command-line interface that lets them:
   * Add a book
   * Remove a book
   * Search for books by title, author, or genre
   * Save the catalog to a file
   * Load the catalog from a file
   
4. The program should also read and write the library catalog to a text file, so that it can be saved between sessions.

To complete this homework, you should implement the `Book` and `LibraryCatalog` classes, and write a program that uses them to create and interact with a library catalog.

To test your program, you should create a sample catalog of at least 10 books, save it to a file, load it from the file, and verify that the books are correctly displayed and searchable.

Your program should be well-documented and include comments explaining the purpose and behavior of each function.

**Submission Instructions**

Please submit your completed Python script (.py file) and a text file containing a sample library catalog. The script should be well-documented, and include comments explaining the purpose and behavior of each function.
